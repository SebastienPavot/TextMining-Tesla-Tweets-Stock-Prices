# Text Mining of Tesla tweets & comparison with stockprices

Using Python to connect to Twitter API and get tweets about Tesla, the goal was to create a script which can be run every day. By updating the data in an SQL server and creating visualizations with PowerBi, the graphs are automatically updated. 

**Below is a gif presenting the Dashboard created on PowerBi:**

*Note: Due to the impossibility of publishing a PowerBi dashboard publicly, it is not accessible but you will find the dashboard in .pbix format which can be run on your computer by installing PowerBi. This dashboard is no longer updated.*
